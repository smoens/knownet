As mentioned in the README-file, this wiki gathers and structures all sorts of information pertaining to my personal and professional development. It can thus touch upon a wide range of topics, from cooking and physical exercise to programming or photography. I love thinking about how to do things more efficiently, I'm a sucker for shortcuts, keyboard shortcuts that is, 'cause I also don't mind working hard and really going beyond my limits to achieve things. I noticed during my college years and employment, that I tend to forget easily. Writing things down serves as a great reference to easily track back things that slipped my mind. It's easy to build upon the things I've written down and move to a new skill level. Although there are always resources available on the internet, and one can google things quite efficiently, it's still easier for me to track back my own notes and creating a structure for content and skill development myself. This wiki is the result of this structuring process. Although it serves as a personal reference, perhaps other people might find something useful as well.
